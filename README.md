# Agent Sven

A keyboard-driven AI coding agent for the terminal. Built in Rust, sven works
as an interactive TUI, a headless CI runner, and a networked node that teams
up with other sven instances — all from the same binary.

---

## What sven does

Give sven a task in plain English. It reads your code, runs commands, writes
files, searches the web, debugs hardware, and delegates subtasks to peer agents
— all autonomously, all in your terminal.

### Interactive TUI

A full-screen Ratatui interface with a scrollable markdown chat log, vim-style
navigation, and live-streamed responses. Swap between a plain ratatui view and
an embedded Neovim buffer with `--nvim`.

### Headless / CI

Reads instructions from stdin or a markdown file, writes clean text to stdout,
and exits with a meaningful code. Designed to compose with other tools via
pipes.

```sh
# Pipe a task
echo "Summarise the project" | sven

# Multi-step workflow file
sven --file plan.md

# Chain agents: plan → implement
sven --file plan.md | sven --mode agent "Implement the plan above."
```

### Node (agent + P2P + HTTP)

```sh
sven node start
```

Runs the full agent plus a P2P networking stack and an HTTPS/WebSocket
endpoint. The node IS the agent — not a proxy. Multiple nodes discover each
other automatically on a local network (or via a relay across the internet) and
can delegate work to each other.

```sh
# Send a task to a running node from the command line
export SVEN_NODE_TOKEN=<token from first startup>
sven node exec "delegate the database migration to backend-agent and the UI changes to frontend-agent"
```

---

## GDB-native hardware debugging

Sven is the **first AI agent with native GDB integration** for autonomous
embedded hardware debugging. Give it a plain-English task and it will start a
GDB server, connect to the target, load your firmware, set breakpoints, inspect
registers and variables, and report its findings — all without leaving your
terminal.

```
You: Use gdb tools to connect to the target, reset it, and set a breakpoint on
     nrf uart tx function. Then inspect the parameters that are passed to it the
     first time and show me what they are. Use zephyr.elf as the executable.
```

The agent then autonomously calls the GDB tools in sequence:

```
gdb_start_server → gdb_connect → gdb_command (×N) → gdb_stop
```

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `gdb_start_server` | Start JLinkGDBServer / OpenOCD / pyocd (auto-discovers config from project files) |
| `gdb_connect` | Connect `gdb-multiarch --interpreter=mi3` and optionally load an ELF |
| `gdb_command` | Run any GDB/MI command and return structured output |
| `gdb_interrupt` | Send Ctrl+C to a running target |
| `gdb_wait_stopped` | Poll until the target halts (after a step, breakpoint, or interrupt) |
| `gdb_status` | Query the current run state and any pending stop events |
| `gdb_stop` | Kill the debug session and free the probe |

See [Example 11](docs/06-examples.md#example-11--embedded-gdb-debugging-session)
and the [User Guide GDB section](docs/03-user-guide.md#gdb-debugging-tools).

## Agent-to-agent task routing

Multiple sven nodes find each other on a local network via mDNS — or across
networks via a relay — and each node automatically gains two tools the LLM can
use during any session:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `list_peers` | List connected peer agents with their name, description, and capabilities |
| `delegate_task` | Send a task to a named peer; the remote agent runs it through its own model+tool loop and returns the full result |

```
You are the orchestrator for a small team. Use list_peers to find who is
online, then:
1. Delegate the database migration to the backend-agent.
2. Delegate the UI changes to the frontend-agent.
3. Summarise what each agent did.
```

sven handles the rest — calling `list_peers`, picking the right peers, calling
`delegate_task` for each, and assembling the results.

See [docs/08-node.md](docs/08-node.md) for setup, security, and configuration.

## Features

### Workflow files — unique to sven

sven treats markdown files as first-class workflow definitions:

```markdown
# Security Audit

Systematic security review of the codebase.

## Understand the codebase
<!-- sven: timeout=60 -->
Read the project structure and summarise the architecture.

## Identify risks
{{context}}
Look for OWASP Top-10 issues and insecure defaults.

## Write report
Produce a structured security report with severity ratings.
```

```sh
sven --file audit.md --var context="Focus on authentication."
```

### Tool suite

The agent has a rich built-in toolset:

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| **Files** | `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `delete_file`, `list_dir` |
| **Search** | `find_file`, `grep`, `search_codebase` |
| **Shell** | `run_terminal_command`, `shell` |
| **Web** | `web_fetch`, `web_search` |
| **Images** | `read_image` |
| **Sub-agents** | `task` — spawn a focused sub-agent for a self-contained subtask |
| **GDB / hardware** | `gdb_start_server`, `gdb_connect`, `gdb_command`, `gdb_interrupt`, `gdb_wait_stopped`, `gdb_status`, `gdb_stop` |
| **Agent networking** | `list_peers`, `delegate_task` *(node mode only)* |
| **Session** | `switch_mode`, `todo_write`, `update_memory`, `ask_question`†, `read_lints`, `load_skill` |

†`ask_question` is only available in interactive TUI sessions.

Each tool call goes through an approval policy — auto-approved, denied, or
presented for confirmation based on glob patterns you configure.

### Skills system

Skills are markdown instruction files that the agent loads on demand to gain
specialized expertise for a task. Skills can encode coding standards, project
conventions, domain knowledge, or multi-step procedures. Load a skill with
`load_skill` or configure auto-loading in `.cursor/skills/`.

### Project awareness

When a session starts, sven automatically:

1. Walks up the directory tree to find the `.git` root.
2. Injects the absolute project path so tools use it for all file operations.
3. Collects live git metadata (branch, commit, remote, dirty status).
4. Reads `.sven/context.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `CLAUDE.md` and injects the
   contents as project-level instructions.

### Persistent memory

`update_memory` writes durable facts to a memory file that is injected at the
start of every session. The agent can learn and remember things about your
project across conversations.

### Pipeable conversations

sven headless output is valid sven conversation markdown — it can be piped
directly into another sven instance:

```sh
# Chain agents: plan → implement
sven --file plan.md | sven --mode agent "Implement the plan above."

# Save the full trace for fine-tuning (includes system prompts, OpenAI format)
sven --file workflow.md --output-jsonl trace.jsonl
```

## Model Providers

Sven supports **32 model providers** natively in Rust — no external gateway
required.

## Agent modes

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| `research` | Read-only tools. Good for exploration and analysis. |
| `plan` | No file writes. Produces structured plans without side effects. |
| `agent` | Full read/write access. Default for interactive use. |

Set with `--mode` or cycle live in the TUI with `F4`.

---

## CI / pipeline mode

When stdin is not a TTY, or when `--headless` is passed, sven enters headless
mode:

- The first `#` H1 heading is the conversation title.
- Text between H1 and the first `##` is appended to the system prompt.
- Each `##` H2 heading is a step sent to the model.
- `<!-- sven: mode=X model=Y timeout=Z -->` directives set per-step options.

```sh
sven --file plan.md                              # run a workflow
sven --file audit.md --output-format json        # structured JSON output
sven --file plan.md --output-last-message out.txt
sven --file workflow.md --output-jsonl trace.jsonl  # full trace for fine-tuning
sven --file review.md --var branch=main --var pr=42
sven validate --file plan.md                     # dry-run: parse only
```

**Exit codes:** `0` success · `1` agent error · `2` validation error · `124` timeout · `130` interrupt

---

## Node — remote access and agent networking

```sh
# Start the node (generates TLS cert and bearer token on first run)
sven node start [--config .node.yaml]

# Send a task to the running node from another terminal
export SVEN_NODE_TOKEN=<token>
sven node exec "What files are in the current directory?"

# Pair a mobile/native operator device
sven node authorize "sven://12D3KooW..."

# Rotate the bearer token
sven node regenerate-token

# List authorized operator devices (NOT agent peers — see below)
sven node list-operators
```

Security defaults — all on, none optional:

| What | Default |
|------|---------|
| HTTP TLS | On — ECDSA P-256, 90-day auto-generated cert |
| TLS version | TLS 1.3 only |
| P2P encryption | Noise protocol (Ed25519), always on |
| P2P authorisation | Deny-all — every operator device must be explicitly paired |
| HTTP binding | `127.0.0.1` — loopback only |
| Bearer token storage | SHA-256 hash only — plaintext never written to disk |

---

## Building

```sh
make build      # debug build
make release    # optimised release build
make deb        # Debian package
```

Requires a recent stable Rust toolchain. No other system dependencies.

---

## Configuration

sven merges YAML config files from lowest to highest priority:

1. `/etc/sven/config.yaml`
2. `~/.config/sven/config.yaml`
3. `.sven/config.yaml`
4. `sven.yaml`
5. `--config <path>`

Run `sven show-config` to see the full resolved config. Key sections:

- `model` — provider, model name, API key env var, base URL override, token limits.
- `agent` — default mode, max autonomous rounds, compaction threshold, system prompt override.
- `tools` — timeout, Docker sandbox, auto-approve and deny glob patterns.
- `tui` — theme, markdown wrap width, ASCII-border fallback.
